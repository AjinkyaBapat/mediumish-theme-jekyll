## About MongoDB

[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/){:target="_blank"} is an open-source document database built on a horizontal scale-out architecture. Founded in 2007, MongoDB has a worldwide following in the developer community. Instead of storing data in tables of rows or columns like SQL databases, each row in a MongoDB database is a document described in JSON, a formatting language.

According to the survey conducted by Scalegrid.io, MongoDB ranks 3rd among Most popular Open Source Databases & 1st among Most Popular NoSQL Databases for the year 2019.

## SQL vs MongoDB

The differences between MongoDB and traditional SQL-based databases are fundamental. When you use Postgres, MySQL, or SQL Server to power a project, you store data in a set of tables that often cross-reference one another to maintain relationships between data points.

MongoDB, on the other hand, doesn’t maintain these relationships. It’s a non-relational database, and anything you want to know about a record needs to be contained within that record itself. That said, you can choose to include data models and linking fields in your collections when creating them, but it’s up to you to enforce those models and keep links working between your MongoDB collections.
